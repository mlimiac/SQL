# For this SQL project, I analyzed a dataset called "Chinook," which is a digital media store.The data includes tables for artists, albums, customers, 
employees, genres, invoices, media tacks, playlists.
#Below are some SQL queries using SQLiteStudio


1.Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US. 
select firstname, lastname, customerID, country
from customers 
Where country <>"USA"
group by firstname

2.Show only the Customers from Brazil.
select firstname, lastname, customerID, country
from customers 
Where country = "Brazil"
group by firstname

3.Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil.
The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.
select c.FirstName, c.Lastname, I.InvoiceID, I.InvoiceDate, I.BillingCountry
from Invoices I
 Join customers c
On I.CustomerId = c.CustomerId
where country = "Brazil"
Group by C.FirstName;


4. Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.
select EmployeeID, LastName, FirstName, Title
from employees
where title like "%agent%"


5. Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.
Select distinct(billingCountry)
from Invoices

6. Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. 
The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.
select e.firstname, e.lastname, e.title, i.invoiceID
from employees e
join invoices i
on e.employeeID = i.InvoiceId
where e.title like "%agent%"
group by e.firstname

7.How many Invoices were there in 2009?
Select Count(InvoiceID)
from invoices
where Invoicedate like "%2009%"

8.What are the total sales for 2009?
select sum(total)
from invoices
where Invoicedate like "%2009%"

9. Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line item.
select t.name, i.invoiceLineId
from invoice_items i 
 join tracks t
on i.trackID = t.TrackID
group by t.trackID

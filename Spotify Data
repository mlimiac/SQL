For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed few analytics on the data using SQL. 

Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

SQL Queries 

1.What is the average danceability by artist and track
Select artist_name, track_name, Avg(danceability)
from Spotifydata
group by artist_name

2.Who are the top 10 artists based on popularity?
Select artist_name,popularity 
from Spotifydata
order by popularity desc limit 10

3.What artist released the longest song?
select artist_name,track_name, (Max)duration_ms as longest song
from spotifydata
limit 1

4. What's the average danceability for the 10 most popular songs? 
Select avg(danceability)
from Spotifydata
Where artist_name In (Select artist_name,popularity
